This repository contains all my Rust projects in a single place.
## Projects

The following is a list of the projects in this repository:

- **guessing-game**: This is a simple command-line game written in Rust. The goal is to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The game will give you feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- More projects to be added soon
